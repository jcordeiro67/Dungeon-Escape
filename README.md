# Dungeon-Escape
Welcome to Dungeon Escape.

This is my project created from the Udemy course,
The Ultimate Guide to 2D Mobile Game Development in Unity.

Dungeon Escape is a 2D Platformer / Dungeon crawler.
Currently the game consists of one level where the user must collect enough
diamonds through out the level to purchase the Key to the Castle while avoiding various enemies.

It contains a simple Inventory system for simple PowerUps.
  The flame sword - Added swing effect to the players sword along with a damage increase, lasts for 2mins.
  Boots of Flight - Increased jump ability and decrease in gravity allowing the player to reach the final castle.
  Key to the Castle - Required item to gain access to the castle to collect end of level score.
  

In the builds folder you will find the various builds availiable.
I have complied several versions of this game from Standalone for 
MacOs, Windows and Linux, along with Mobile options for IOS and Android.

I am still working on a WebGL version to host.
